Create a pull request for the current branch.

## Current state

- Branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Git status: !`git status`
- Commits on this branch: !`git log --oneline main..HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "Could not diff against main"`

## PR template

The PR body format is defined in [pull_request_template.md](../../../.github/pull_request_template.md). Fill in its sections with concrete details from the branch's changes. GitHub also uses this template when PRs are created through the web UI.

## Steps

1. **Clean working tree.** If there are uncommitted changes, commit them first (use `/project:commit`).

2. **Validate.** Run the full quality gate pipeline (`/project:validate`). All gates must pass.

3. **Review full session scope.** The PR covers ALL commits on this branch, not just the latest one. Review every commit and the cumulative diff:
   ```sh
   git log --oneline main..HEAD
   git diff main...HEAD --stat
   git diff main...HEAD
   ```
   Read through the full diff. The summary must reflect the entire body of work.

4. **Push** if not already pushed:
   ```sh
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

5. **Create PR** using `gh pr create`. Fill in the template sections — replace comments with real content, check off completed items:
   ```sh
   gh pr create --title "type: short descriptive title" --fill-first
   ```

## Guidelines

- **Title**: Conventional commit format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`), under 72 chars, imperative mood
- **Summary**: Cover all changes on the branch, not just the last commit. Group related changes into coherent bullet points
- **Scope**: One theme per PR. The theme can span multiple commits as long as they serve the same goal
- **Tests**: New behavior needs tests. Bug fixes need regression tests
- **Docs**: Update `docs/technical.md` for architectural changes

Return the PR URL when done.
